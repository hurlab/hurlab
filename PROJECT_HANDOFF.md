# PROJECT_HANDOFF.md

## 1. Project Overview

**Purpose**: Modern, data-driven academic website for the Hur Lab (Dr. Junguk Hur, UND Biomedical Sciences). Fully redesigned from legacy HTML4 frameset site. All page content driven by JSON data files, with an admin panel for content management and a CV parser for automated publication/grant updates.

**Scope**: 9 HTML pages (8 public + 1 research detail), admin server (port 8180), CV parser script, 8 JSON data files. Deployed on Apache Tomcat 9.0.37 with nginx reverse proxy.

- **Last updated**: 2026-03-25 14:39 CDT
- **Last coding CLI used**: Claude Code CLI (Claude Opus 4.6)
- **Git repo**: https://github.com/hurlab/hurlab.git (branch: main)

## 5. Risks, Open Questions, and Assumptions

| Item | Status | Opened | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| HTTPS unreachable externally | Open | 2026-03-14 | University firewall blocks port 443. Contact UND IT. Site works via HTTP. |
| Tailwind Play CDN first-load delay | Open | 2026-03-14 | ~200-400ms, acceptable for academic site |
| Team member photos mostly missing | Open | 2026-03-14 | Only PI and Brett McGregor have photos; admin panel supports upload |
| Admin server not auto-started | Open | 2026-03-14 | Needs systemd service or cron @reboot entry |

## 7. Restart Instructions

**Site URL**: `http://hurlab.med.und.edu/hurlab/`
**Admin panel**: `http://hurlab.med.und.edu:8180/` (credentials in `scripts/.admin_credentials`)
**Git repo**: `https://github.com/hurlab/hurlab.git`

**Starting the admin server** (if not running):
```bash
cd /home/hurlab/apache-tomcat-9.0.37/webapps/hurlab/scripts
bash start_admin.sh
```

**Directory structure**:
```
hurlab/           ← webroot (Tomcat webapp)
  *.html          ← 8 public pages + research-detail.html
  css/, js/       ← styles and scripts
  data/           ← 8 JSON data files (the "database")
  Images/         ← photos
  Personal/       ← CV PDF (symlinks)
  scripts/        ← admin_server.py, parse_cv.py, templates/
  cgi-bin/        ← active Perl CGI tools
  miRNA/          ← active miRNA BLAST tools
  v1/             ← legacy site + archived directories
```

**Recommended next actions**:
1. Image optimization (compress existing JPGs)
2. Add admin panel tabs for editing collaborators, research areas, and positions JSON
3. Set up admin server auto-start (systemd or cron)
4. Mobile responsiveness testing
5. Contact UND IT about HTTPS/port 443
